# U2U Network stats 

Crawls the network and visualizes collected data. This repository includes backend, API and frontend for U2U network crawler.


- [Discovery](./discovery) is based on [devp2p](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/tree/master/cmd/devp2p) tool. It tries to connect to discovered nodes, fetches info about them and creates a database.
- [Crawler](./crawler) is based on JSONRPC modules, which crawl network backbone data as raw data for futher processing/transform.

 [API](./api) software reads transformed node database, filters it, caches and serves as API. 
 
[Frontend](./frontend) is a web application which reads data from the API and visualizes them as a dashboard.

Features:
- Capture all network data and transform for advanced purpose such as staking stats, monitor.
- Advanced filtering, allows you to add filters for a customized dashboard
- Drilldown support, allows you to drill down the data to find interesting trends
- Network upgrade readiness overview
- Responsive mobile design

## Contribute

Project is still in an early stage, contribution and testing is welcomed. You can run manually each part of the software for development purposes or deploy whole production ready stack with Docker.

### Frontend

#### Development

For local development with debugging, remoting, etc:

1. Copy `.env` into `.env.local` and replace the variables.
2. And then `npm install` then `npm start`
3. Run tests to make sure the data processing is working good. `npm test`

#### Production

To deploy this web app:

1. Build the production bits by `npm install` then `npm run build` the contents will be located in `build` folder.
1. Use your favorite web server, in this example we will be using nginx.
1. The nginx config for that website could be which proxies the api to endpoint `/v1`.
   Review the `frontent/nginx.conf` file for an example.

### Backend API

The API is using 2 databases. 1 of them is the raw data from the crawler and the other one is the API database.
Data will be moved from the crawler DB to the API DB regularly by this binary.
Make sure to start the crawler before the API if you intend to run them together during development.

#### Dependencies

- golang
- sqlite3

#### Development

```
go run ./cmd/crawler
```

#### Production

1. Build the assembly into `/usr/bin`
   ```
   go build ./cmd/cralwer -o /usr/bin/node-crawler
   ```
1. Create a system user for running the application
   ```
   useradd --system --create-home --home-dir /var/lib/node-crawler node-crawler
   ```
1. Make sure database is in `/var/lib/node-crawler/crawler.db`
1. Create a systemd service in `/etc/systemd/system/node-crawler.service`:
   ```
   [Unit]
   Description = eth node crawler api
   Wants       = network-online.target
   After       = network-online.target

   [Service]
   User       = node-crawler
   ExecStart  = /usr/bin/node-crawler api --crawler-db /var/lib/node-crawler/crawler.db --api-db /var/lib/node-crawler/api.db
   Restart    = on-failure
   RestartSec = 3
   TimeoutSec = 300

   [Install]
   WantedBy = multi-user.target
   ```
1. Then enable it and start it.
   ```
   systemctl enable node-crawler
   systemctl start node-crawler
   systemctl status node-crawler
   ```

### Crawler

#### Dependencies

- golang
- sqlite3

##### Country location

- `GeoLite2-Country.mmdb` file from [https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolite2-free-geolocation-data?lang=en](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolite2-free-geolocation-data?lang=en)
  - you will have to create an account to get access to this file

#### Development

```
go run ./cmd/crawler
```

Run crawler using `crawl` command.

```
go run ./cmd/crawler crawl
```

#### Production

Build crawler and copy the binary to `/usr/bin`.

```
go build ./cmd/crawler -o /usr/bin/node-crawler
```

Create a systemd service similarly to above API example. In executed command, override default settings by pointing crawler database to chosen path and setting period to write crawled nodes.
If you want to get the country that a Node is in you have to specify the location the geoIP database as well.

##### No GeoIP

```
node-crawler crawl --timeout 10m --crawler-db /path/to/database
```

##### With GeoIP

```
node-crawler crawl --timeout 10m --crawler /path/to/database --geoipdb GeoLite2-Country.mmdb
```

### Docker setup

Production build of preconfigured software stack can be easily deployed with Docker. To achieve this, clone this repository and access `docker` directory.

Make sure you have [Docker](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce/releases) and [docker-compose](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases) tools installed.

The docker compose uses a local `./data` directory to store the database and GeoIP file.
It's best to create this directory and add the GeoIP file before starting the system.
You can read the `./docker-compose.yml` file for more details.

```
docker-compose up
```

## Developing with Nix

[Nix](https://nixos.org/) is a package manager and system configuration tool
and language for reproducible, declarative, and reliable systems.

The Nix [Flake](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) in this repo contains all the
dependencies needed to build the frontend and crawler.

The `flake.lock` file locks the commit which the package manager uses to build
the packages. Essentially locking the dependencies in time, not in version.

To update the lock file, use `nix flake update --commit-lock-file` this will
update the git commits in the lock file, and commit the new lock file with a
nice, standard commit message which shows the change in commit hashes for each
input.

To activate the development environment with all the packages available, you
can use the command `nix develop`. To automate this process, you can use
[direnv](https://direnv.net/) with `use flake` in your `.envrc`. You can learn
more about Nix and direnv [here](https://github.com/direnv/direnv/wiki/Nix).

## Deploying with NixOS

[Nix](https://nixos.org/) is a package manager and system configuration tool
and language for reproducible, declarative, and reliable systems.

The Nix [Flake](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) in this repo also contains a
NixOS module for configuring and deploying the node-crawler, API, and Nginx.

There is just a little bit of extra configuration which is needed to bring
everything together.

An example production configuration:

Your NixOS `flake.nix`:

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    node-crawler.url = "github:ethereum/node-crawler";
  };
  outputs = {
    nixpkgs,
    node-crawler,
  }:
  {
    nixosConfigurations = {
      crawlerHostName = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
        specialArgs = {
          inherit node-crawler
        };
        modules = [
          ./configuration.nix

          node-crawler.nixosModules.nodeCrawler
        ];
      };
    };
  };
}
```

Your example `configuration.nix`:

```nix
{ node-crawler, ... }:

{
  # Add the overlay from the node-crawler flake
  # to get the added packages.
  nixpkgs.overlays = [
    node-crawler.overlays.default
  ];

  # It's a good idea to have your firewall
  # enabled. Make sure you have SSH allowed
  # so you don't lock yourself out. The openssh
  # service should do this by default.
  networking = {
    firewall = {
      enable = true;
      allowedTCPPorts = [
        80
        443
      ];
    };
  };

  services = {
    nodeCrawler = {
      enable = true;
      hostName = "server hostname";
      nginx = {
        forceSSL = true;
        enableACME = true;
      };
    };

    # Needed for the node crawler to get the country
    # of the crawled IP address.
    geoipupdate = {
      enable = true;
      settings = {
        EditionIDs = [
          "GeoLite2-Country"
        ];
        AccountID = account_id;
        LicenseKey = "location of licence key on server";
      };
    };
  };

  # Needed to enable ACME for automatic SSL certificate
  # creation for Nginx.
  security.acme = {
    acceptTerms = true;
    defaults.email = "admin+acme@example.com";
  };
}
```
